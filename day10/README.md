# Day 10

## Part 1
So I didn't properly read the question and initially thought the problem statement was asking me to count the number of valid trails. It was not too hard to modify my existing solution: instead of counting valid trails, I just added the final locations to a set. Then for each trailhead, the length of the set provided its score. Because I first solved the wrong problem and then adapted my solution, it was admittedly a little clunky (no early termination after a final location had been reached). But by incredible fortune, the initial solution did solve the problem statement for part 2.

## Part 2
Trivial after poor reading comprehension.
