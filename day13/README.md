# Day 13

## Part 1
This was a fairly straightforward problem. I used regular expressions to extract the relevant numbers for a given claw machine. For a given set of claw machine rules, we had a simple system of equations that we could solve with a simple 2x2 matrix. If the resulting solution contained integer values, we had a valid solution and could calculate the cost associated with each of the button presses.

## Part 2
This was effectively a single-line change to how the matrices were created, but otherwise we were solving the same problem using the same tools as before.
